# ClassicModels SQL Project  

## 📌 Overview
This project is based on the ClassicModels sample database in MySQL.  
The goal is to perform SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using different SQL concepts.  

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses the ClassicModels sample database.  
You can find the SQL file here: [Classicmodel.sql] (https://github.com/GayatriNawade/ClassicModels-SQL-Project/blob/80c66fb1a6d518006351af006bf6917034cd0ab2/mysqlsampledatabase.sql)

### 🔹 How to Import
1. Open MySQL Workbench.  
2. Go to *Server > Data Import*.  
3. Select *Import from Self-Contained File* and choose classicmodels.sql.  
4. Click *Start Import*.  
5. Refresh schemas and start running queries.






## 📊 Topics Covered
- **Basic Exploration** (SELECT, WHERE, filtering) <br>
  *Definition:* Basic queries used to explore data from a single table. <br> 
  *Use:* Retrieve data using SELECT, filter with WHERE, sort using ORDER BY.
  
- **Joins Practice** <br>
  *Definition:* Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.  <br>
  *Types:* 
  - INNER JOIN → common records only  
  - LEFT JOIN → all records from left table + matched from right  
  - RIGHT JOIN → all records from right table + matched from left  
  - FULL JOIN (not in MySQL directly) → all records from both sides
    
- **Aggregates & Grouping** <br>
  *Definition:* Aggregate functions are used to calculate values from multiple rows.<br>  
  *Functions:* COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN(). <br>
  *Use with GROUP BY:* To group rows and calculate totals/averages per group.  
  
- **Subqueries & Insights** <br>
 *Definition:* A query inside another query.  <br>
 *Types:*  
  - Single-row subquery (returns one value)  
  - Multi-row subquery (returns multiple values)  
  - Correlated subquery (depends on outer query)
   
- **Stored Procedures** <br>
*Definition:* A stored procedure is a saved SQL code that can be reused.  <br>
*Benefits:*  
  - Reusability  
  - Reduces repetition  
  - Improves performance for repeated tasks
  
- **Advanced Clauses** <br>
*Definition:* Advanced SQL features to handle complex queries.  <br>
*Examples:*  
  - HAVING → filter after grouping  
  - CASE → conditional logic in queries  
  - LIMIT → restrict number of results

- **Business Insights** <br>
*Definition:* SQL queries that help in making business decisions. <br>
*Use:* Analyzing revenue, sales trends, customer value, product performance.  <br>


## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- MySQL Workbench
- ClassicModels Sample Database

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Import the 'classicmodels.sql' database into MySQL.
2. Open the 'SQL_Project_file'.
4. Run the queries in MySQL Workbench to see the results.

## Conclusion -

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to explore and analyze business data using the ClassicModels database. By applying joins, aggregations, subqueries, stored procedures, and advanced SQL clauses, meaningful insights were generated about sales, customers, and product performance. Overall, the project strengthens practical SQL skills and shows how data-driven decisions can be made using real-world datasets.
